I'm a software developer from The Gambia. I specilize in building full stack applications with more focus on the backend. I am currently building a knock-off of the famous Node.js backend framework, Express.js. It is called NotExpress, and you can find it on my Github below. Over the past couple of years, I have worked on some projects that I have open sourced. I have also picked up on writing tutorials and guides.

Skills: React.js, Node.js/Express, JavaScript, React Native, MySQL
